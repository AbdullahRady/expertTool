After a few minutes of stress, they decided to look for the horses and beyond the river, beside a rock, they found the animals at a little lake that looked 'magic': the water was warm, as vapours came up, and the air smelled of sulphur. Moving close to the horses, the boys saw that the wounded paws were healed: a miracle of a deity, they thought at the beginning! However, they understood that in that place there were thermomineral sources and as Roman medicine taught, the sulphurous waters cured all the wounds. So the friends realized that the horses had instinctively gone to the lake to find a natural cure and they decided to have a long bath themselves, for healing their wounded legs. Then, the men decided to move forward to a beautiful landscape with typical aquatic flowers, following the channel of the river that was flanked by a road. During their travel they met people: merchants with their products, men and women on litters with slaves, soldiers, but in particular ill people on charts or walking with crutches. Most of them were proceeding to a settlement that appeared in the horizon, but they could not see walls or towers of a town. In fact, they reached a village, where everything was linked to water: everywhere they saw hot and vaporous springs, channels, aqueducts and pools, but also nice fountains with normal and fresh water.",

The waters also arrived in several sacred spaces with altars and basins, where people left their gifts: both before taking the waters and after the healing treatments. Around the shrines the boys noticed shops displaying various objects for the water deities: little altars, statuettes, reliefs, bottles, glasses, vessels. There were also anatomical objects of pottery, both human and animal: hands, legs, feet, eyes of men and women, but also paws and hoofs of horses, cows and sheep, free standing statuettes, vases. Because those waters cured their horses, the friends decided to offer a gift in a sacred space dedicated to Apollon. They chose two horses-shapes ceramic vases - very expensive! - and went into the shrine for doing the ritual expected. A minister indicated them a hot spring close to an altar and saying a formula, they poured the water in to a basin; after this they left the vases near the altar.",

At the entrance, on the floor, the mosaic showed the writing «Bonus intra, melior exi» («Good enter, better exit») and they put an offering in a box, as was expected. Immediately two servants moved close to them and took them into a dressing room, where they found towels. Then, they stepped into a portico that enclosed halls and several pools, with hot, warm and cold water channelled from the nearby springs; on one side there was also a room for sauna with dry and hot vapours. Because loud people were swimming in the larger pool, the friends decided to move to the smaller round basin, where two nice girls were having a bath. With the excuse of the leg-wound, they began to talk and they heard that the girls were free people who had come from Patavium to solve some nerves problems, but even Hadrian had been there to cure an eye-disease; for that occasion, a local benefactor paid for doing improvements. Before that, Tiberius had arrived from Rome to consult the oracle: it was far from the spa, but if they had gone they could have seen the gold dice that the emperor threw into the basin.",

					"text": "After some treatments with ointments, mud and massage therapies, the men and the women decided to go in a tavern close to the healing complex: they ate cereals, meat, fruit with honey and obviously a lot of drinks, wine and water. During the lunch, they talked about the beauty of the site and about the cultural activities organized there: places for sports, theatre shows, music and dance competitions, singing performances, readings of famous poems. The women preferred to go to the theatre and they choose the best seats at the centre of the (cavea) auditorium. During the performance, the men were attracted by the decoration of the building: the marble ornaments of the scenery, the objects set on the stage, a hydraulic system set in a pool in the orchestra pit, where warm and steamy waters were channelled so as to create water games. When the show ended at sunset, the boys said good bye to the girls and left them. The friends were trying to find accommodation when they heard shouts coming from a small street: an old woman with a modest grey tunic was shooting a man from a private home and from an upper window two men threw a pair of sandals and two dice against him. The man picked up these objects, and quickly ran and disappeared behind the house; the friends enquired from a slave of the house and he replied that he hadn’t paid his gambling debts. Talking with the slave, the men also asked if he could suggest a place to sleep: «The Ianuarius hotel is the best for you» he said, telling them it was across the street. The building was mediocre but cheap and they decided to remain there, even if there was a luxurious hotel nearby; the room was not so clean but their window looked onto the back of the hotel, so they didn't hear the noise of the night life.",

On one side of the road leading to Patavium they saw a little thermal lake attended by poor people and flanked by sheds and simple shelters, whereas on a secondary road a shepherd with his flock was going to a separate basin close to small vaporous springs. On the other side there was an aristocratic villa: the friends glimpsed the rich furniture of the outside of the building, while in a rustic annex there was equipment and tools for agricultural activities. The owners had put a sundial at the entrance path, near the street: it was the fourth hour, approximately 9 o'clock. With their horses they proceeded slowly to watch the funerary monuments standing on the sides: they noticed in particular some burial places of people who had worked in the thermal village: the inscription of a flutist with the image of the flute and a monument of a mime actress and juggler called Claudia Toreuma. In the inscription the traveller could read that she had died when she was nineteen years old: she had avoided the long and awful old age, so she was happy to have died early. With all these experiences and sensations the friends left the thermal village and continued their travels, hoping that in the future they would come back here.",
